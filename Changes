- The offset_as_string function did not handle negative offsets
properly.  Patch from Kellan.

- Allow 'Z' as an offset name, equivalent to 'UTC'.  Patch from
Kellan.

- Make sure DT::TZ subclasses which need to override
is_dst_for_datetime do so.

- Changed offset_as_seconds and offset_as_string so that the former
always assumes its arg is a string and the latter always assumes it
got a number.

- Be forgiving of bad names in $ENV{TZ} and just calculate local
offset instead.

0.03     2003-02-09

- Fixed bug in new method that should have caused DateTime::TimeZone
to not be loadable.

- Added is_dst_for_datetime method.

0.02     2003-02-09

- Updated version number to non-dev-release so that it's visible when
CPAN.pm looks for it as a prereq to DateTime.pm.  Otherwise identical
to 0.02 and still alpha/beta-ish.

0.01_01  2003-02-06

- Don't make pod for generated timezone modules.

- Fix a buglet that caused test 01load.t to fail with some versions of
Test::More.  Reported by John Peacock.

0.01_00  2003-02-04
