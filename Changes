0.10     2003-03-20

- Fixed a bug in the DateTime::TimeZone::offset_as_seconds bug when
trying given a negative number that resulted in an offset that
included minutes (not a whole hour).  Found by Flavio Glock.

0.09     2003-02-26

- Fixed an infinite recursion bug in generating future time zone data
that occurred when $ENV{TZ} was something like "America/Chicago".
Sort of reported by Eugene van der Pijll ;)

0.08     2003-02-22

- Fix handling of "local" time zone so that it passes a string to the
OffsetOnly constructor instead of a number.  Reported by Eric Cholet.

- Fix DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly documentation to specify that
offset must be specified as string, not a number.

0.07     2003-02-19

- Skip tests unless DateTime.pm 0.06 is installed.  Otherwise we have
a bootstrapping problem since DateTime 0.06 needs DateTime::TimeZone
0.06+.

0.06     2003-02-16

- Changes to work with DateTime.pm 0.06.

- DateTime::TimeZone::offset_as_seconds handles '0' properly.

- Fix a bug in handling future times for time zones with recurring
rules.  The symptom would be the error "Invalid local time for date
..."

- Time zone data is now stored in a simple array, and searched using a
binary search algorithm.  This eliminates the need to install
Tree::RedBlack, and makes looking up time zone data quicker.
Suggested by Jonathan Peacock.

0.05     2003-02-13

- The offset_as_string function did not handle negative offsets
properly.  Patch from Kellan Elliott-McCrea.

- Allow 'Z' as an offset name, equivalent to 'UTC'.  Patch from
Kellan Elliott-McCrea.

- Make sure DT::TZ subclasses which need to override
is_dst_for_datetime do so.

- Changed offset_as_seconds and offset_as_string so that the former
always assumes its arg is a string and the latter always assumes it
got a number.

0.04     2003-02-10

- Be forgiving of bad names in $ENV{TZ} and just calculate local
offset instead.

0.03     2003-02-09

- Fixed bug in new method that should have caused DateTime::TimeZone
to not be loadable.

- Added is_dst_for_datetime method.

0.02     2003-02-09

- Updated version number to non-dev-release so that it's visible when
CPAN.pm looks for it as a prereq to DateTime.pm.  Otherwise identical
to 0.02 and still alpha/beta-ish.

0.01_01  2003-02-06

- Don't make pod for generated timezone modules.

- Fix a buglet that caused test 01load.t to fail with some versions of
Test::More.  Reported by John Peacock.

0.01_00  2003-02-04

- Initial alpha release
