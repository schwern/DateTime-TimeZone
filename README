OVERVIEW

The DateTime::TimeZone modules provide a Perl interface to the Olson
time zone database.  Rather than using the database directly, we parse
the database files and turn them into a set of modules, one for each
time zone defined.  This allows for various optimizations in doing
time zone calculations.  This conversion is done with the script in
tools/parse_olson.

The Olson time zone database is the best available source for world
wide time zone information.  It is available from
ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/.  A good starting point for information
on the database, and time zones in general, is
http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following in the distribution
directory:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

This distribution is dependent on DateTime.pm, but it does not list it
as a prerequisite.  This is because DateTime.pm is in turn dependent
on this distribution, and we don't want to create a cyclical chain of
prerequisites!

This distribution will skip its tests if DateTime.pm isn't yet
installed.  If this weren't done, then neither module would be
installable via CPAN.  But this distribution's functionality only
works in concert with DateTime.pm.

If you want to run the tests for this module locally, you'll need to
install it, then install DateTime.pm, and only then run this module's
tests.

PERL 5.6.0

This module probably won't work with Perl 5.6.0, according to reports
I've had from users.
